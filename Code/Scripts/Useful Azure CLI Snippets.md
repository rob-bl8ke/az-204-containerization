To deploy an ARM template with [Azure CLI look here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-cli).

Get help with the [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) (CLI) documentation

For help with usage of JMESPath look [here](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) and [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/query-azure-cli?tabs=concepts%2Cbash).

Use `Get-Command -AzResourceGroup` to find the commands for a specific item you might know something about. If we’re working with functions so a good strategy would be to `Get-Command New-AzFunc`.

To look at a file `cat ./javascriptfunc/index.js`.

### Locations

`az account list-locations` will give you a list of locations you can choose from. Try this one to be less verbose: `az account list-locations --query "[].name"` or even this one `az account list-locations --query "[].{ name: name, displayName: displayName }"`.

## Environment Variables

- [How to set and use Environment Variables in a Bash script](https://ioflood.com/blog/bash-environment-variables/#:~:text=To%20set%20a%20bash%20environment,Output%3A%20%23%20Hello%2C%20World!)
- Using Bash, you can simply fetch an environment variable by refering to it. If its there, the value will be displayed.

```bash
echo $QikWebAppContainerPrefix
```
